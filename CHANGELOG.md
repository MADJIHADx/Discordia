### 1.0.0

- General

	- All mentions of *server* or *Server* were changed to *guild* or *Guild* to maintain consistency with internal Discord nomenclature
	- Methods that use the REST API and that previously returned nothing now return a boolean to indicate whether the call was successful
	- Discord-compliant ratelimiting has been implemented
	- User handling has been changed slightly:
		- `User` objects are now cached once per `Client` instead of per every `PrivateChannel` and `Guild`
		- The `Member` class now wraps the `User` class instead of extending it
		- To get a user's `Member` object, use `User:getMembership(guild)`
		- A member's `User` object is accessed via `Member.user`
		- Message authors, channel recipients, and invite inviters are always `User` objects
		- Guild owners and members are always `Member` objects
	- `utils` was removed from the main `discordia` module and has been replaced by individual utility classes
	- `Warning` and `Error` classes were removed in favor of events
		- Gateway disconnects, nil values on events, and HTTP errors are now handled more gracefully
	- All modules relevant to the `Client` class were refactored and moved with it into a `client` folder:
		- `Client` now extends a custom version of Luvit's built-in `Emitter`
			- Client instances are initialized using `discordia.Client()` instead of `discordia.Client:new()`
			- A table of options can be passed to the client initializer. Currently supported options are:
				- `routeDelay`: minimum time to wait between requests per-route (default: 300 ms)
				- `globalDelay`: minimum time to wait between requests globally after a global 429 (default: 10 ms)
				- `messageLimit`: limit to the number of cached messages per channel (default: 100)
				- `largeThreshold`: limit to how many members are initially fetched per-guild on start-up (default: 100)
				- `fetchMembers`: whether to fetch all members for all guilds (default: false)
				- `autoReconnect`: whether to attempt to reconnect after an unexpected gateway disconnection (default: true)
		- `endpoints` was changed to `API`
		- `events` was changed to `EventHandler`
		- `WebSocket` was changed to `Socket`
	- Discord objects are now stored in custom `Cache` objects instead of pure Lua tables
	- Many iterators were added to help with accessing cached objects or methods that used to return a table
	- The entire class system was overhauled
		- Internally used properties and methods are now prefixed with an underscore to indicate their protected status
		- Getter and setter properties and methods have been added.
			- For every public property that can be accessed/mutated, there is an associated get/set method
			```lua
			-- these lines examples are equivalent
			local name = guild.name
			local name = guild:getName()
			```
			```lua
			-- these lines examples are equivalent
			guild.name = "foo"
			guild:setName("foo")
			```
		- Objects that have caches have a variety of get and find methods for accessing those caches. For example:
			- `guild:getRoles()` or `guild.roles` - returns an iterator for all roles in the guild
			- `guild:getRoleCount()` or `guild.roleCount` - returns the number of roles cached
			- `guild:getRole(id)` - returns the role with the given Snowflake ID
			- `guild:getRole(key, value)` - returns the first found role matching a key, value pair
			- `guild:getRoles(key, value)` - returns an iterator for all roles matching the key, value pair
			- `guild:findRole(predicate)` - returns the first found role that makes the predicate true
			- `guild:findRoles(predicate)` - returns an iterator for all roles that makes the predicate true
			```lua
			-- pre-1.0 code
			for _, role in pairs(guild.roles) do
			    print(role)
			end
			```
			```lua
			-- 1.0 code ...
			for role in guild.roles do
				print(role)
			end

			for role in guild:getRoles() do
				print(role)
			end
			```

	- `serverDelete` was renamed/split into `guildDelete` and `guildUnavailable`

	- `memberBan` and `memberUnban` were renamed to `userBan` and `userUnban` and now provide a `User` object instead of a `Member` object
	- `voiceJoin` and `VoiceLeave` were renamed/split into `VoiceChannel[Join|Leave]` and `voice[Connected|Disconnect]`
	- `typingStart` now has a timestamp as a third argument
	- `messageUpdateUncached` and `messageDeleteUncached` events were added for uncached message events
	- `warning` and `error` events were added
	- `heartbeat` event was added with event sequence and roundtrip latency arguments


- New Classes

	- `API` - Adds a layer of abstraction between Discord's REST API and Discordia's object oriented API
	- `Container` - Base object used to store Discord objects
	- `Cache` - Data structure used to store and access `Container` objects
	- `Emitter` - A simplified re-write of Luvit's built-in event emitter
	- `Mutex` - Extension of `Deque` that is used by the `API` class to throttle HTTP requests
	- `OrderedCache` - Extension of `Cache` that maintains the order of objects as a doubly-linked list
	- `Stopwatch` - Used to measure elapsed time with nanosecond precision
	- `PermissionOverwrite` - Extension of `Snowflake` that maintains per-channel permissions
